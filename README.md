## FitsGeo
An easy way to define and visualise geometry for PHITS input files.

Define any PHITS surface as python object and manipulate it 
getting and setting properties (get center, volume, area etc) on the fly. 

With the help of VPython library all defined geometry may be viewed 
from any point which really boosts developing and helps with 
complicated geometries in PHITS.
